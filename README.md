📜 Paper Abstract
Train environment perception is critical for ensuring operational safety, especially in adverse conditions such as foggy weather or tunnel darkness. Existing image restoration methods often fail to generalize across diverse scenarios and lack the specificity required to recover fine details in complex textures.
To address this, we propose a Dynamic Hybrid Expert (DHE) image restoration framework, integrating multiple expert branches and a dynamic weight generation mechanism. Each expert specializes in distinct feature restoration, enabling adaptive enhancement tailored to fog, low-light, or multi-degraded environments.

Key innovations:

🌫️ Specialized expert modules for foggy, low-light, and tunnel scenes

⚖️ Dynamic weight generation network to fuse expert outputs adaptively

🔄 Encoder-decoder attention mechanism for global-local feature integration

💡 Robust performance across various adverse railway scenarios
